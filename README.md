# Liminal Space â€“ A Virtual Sound & Visual Installation

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47612276/208315748-1bdd4fa6-5778-4d9d-9592-84699441604b.mov

Liminal spaces are transitory environmentsâ€”empty hallways, deserted waiting rooms, surreal architectureâ€”that evoke feelings of isolation, nostalgia, and unease.

This virtual installation explores the concept of liminality through both visual representation and sound design. The visuals aim to portray a space that is familiar yet uncanny, while the audio component builds a virtual soundscape by manipulating recordings of known environments. By accentuating or stripping away natural elements from these sounds, the result is an abstract, immersive, and unsettling experience.

ðŸ”Š Key Concepts:

- Visual representation of liminal architecture
- Sound design based on altered familiar environments
- Exploration of virtual space as an emotional and psychological experience
- Intended to evoke feelings of detachment, ambiguity, and unease

This is an artistic exploration of the boundaries between physical and psychological space, where the familiar becomes unfamiliar.
